## Self introduction
#### I am a second-year PhD student in the University of Rhode Island. I am from Taiwan and this is my second year living in the United States. I live in an off-campus dormitory, and my roommate has a very cute Maltese. I like life in the United States very much because there are many beautiful cabins, scenery and beaches. But the weather here is very cold for me, so I need heater in the winters.
